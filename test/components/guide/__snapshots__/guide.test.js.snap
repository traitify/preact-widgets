        Solving Problems
      </h2>
      At the top level, Solving Problems (O) concerns how someone thinks about work problems, projects
and challenges, how receptive they are to new or different information or approaches, and the way this
influences their decision making.

            Question 1
          </h3>
          <p>
            Tell me how you would go about solving a work problem you have not encountered before.
          </p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                Do they talk about a number of different ways of approaching the problem?
              </li>
              <li>
                Are their ideas new, original or different in any way? Do they test new ideas against what seems feasible,
both now and in the longer term? Producing new ideas but checking their viability, and implementing
balanced and timely solutions, are all aspects of the open-minded/pragmatic character.
And to probe into possible issues with being open-minded/pragmatic:

            Question 2
          </h3>
          <p>
            (Your results suggest you like to think about new ideas and possibilities). Give me an example
of a time when you had to be practical and realistic, and work to a fixed set of rules.

                tension between this and wanting to try something new? Does this 'conflict' sometimes show itself in taking

                <li>
                  existing procedure, or to be far less cautious and try something radically different? Can they give an example
of using either of these extremes? What do they do to stop themselves getting stuck on the 'middle way' of
doing things?

            Question 3
          </h3>
          <p>
            (Your results suggest you are a grounded person but also someone who thinks about future
possibilities.) Can you describe a work situation where you realized that you hadn't learned from a similar
situation in the past. What happened and what did you do?

              <li>
                without consolidating what they have learned? Do they sometimes override their experience because they
think they need to demonstrate original thought?

                <li>
                  Can they provide an example of sticking with experience, and the tried-and-tested, even though they
wanted to try something fresh?
