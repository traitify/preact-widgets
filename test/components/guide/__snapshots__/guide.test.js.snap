                Do they test new ideas against what seems feasible, both now and in the longer term? Producing new ideas but checking their viability, and implementing balanced and timely solutions, are all aspects of the open-minded/pragmatic character.

      <p>
        The benefits of being open-minded are likely to include approaching problems in original ways, making quick connections, pushing boundaries, seeing the bigger picture, and not getting stuck in the detail.
In contrast someone who is pragmatic likes to solve problems in practical ways, and prefers tried-andtested solutions or established rules and regulations.
They are likely to have a fine eye for detail, be results oriented, and able to bring experience to bear on a problem.
Those who are a mixture of both (openminded/pragmatic) are best described as approaching problems in a systematic way, being able to flex between different options, capable of seeing situations at different levels of detail, and as bringing healthy caution to decision making.
These personality characteristics provide the basis for asking a particular sequence of questions of each of the personality 'types'.
The first question is looking to confirm what they should be like; the second two explore areas of possible concern.

                Do they test new ideas against what seems feasible, both now and in the longer term? Producing new ideas but checking their viability, and implementing balanced and timely solutions, are all aspects of the open-minded/pragmatic character.

            Question 2
          </h3>
          <p>
            (Your results suggest you like to think about new ideas and possibilities). Give me an example of a time when you had to be practical and realistic, and work to a fixed set of rules.

              <li>
                Is there a tension between this and wanting to try something new?

              <li>
                Does this 'conflict' sometimes show itself in taking a very cautious approach?

                </li>
                <li>
                  Can they give an example of using either of these extremes?

                <li>

            Question 3
          </h3>
          <p>
            (Your results suggest you are a grounded person but also someone who thinks about future possibilities.) Can you describe a work situation where you realized that you hadn't learned from a similar situation in the past. What happened and what did you do?

                Do they sometimes override their experience because they think they need to demonstrate original thought?
